# MIS310_PythonProjects
This portfolio was made for MIS 310: Contemporary Business Applications Development I. It includes different Python projects I built during the class. Each project shows what I learned about using code to solve problems, create games, and build useful tools.

1. SnowDay_Tracker (Based on Average Rainfall Program). Description: This program tracks the number of snow days for each month over a number of years. It was based on a rainfall calculator but changed to focus on snow days. What It Works: Asks how many years to track, collects snow day data, shows total and average snow days per year, finds the snowiest month and year, and only allows values between 0 and 31

2. 10Day_FitnessChallenge_Tracker (Based on Book Club Award and Step Tracker Programs). Description: This program tracks a user's progress during a 10-day fitness challenge. Each day, the user enters their step count and whether they completed a 7-minute workout. The program awards points based on activity and shows the total at the end. How Points Work: 1 point for 10,000 or more steps, 2 points for completing the 7-minute workout, Max of 3 points per day, 25 points or more = earns a free workout session.  How It works: Repeats for 10 days, collects daily input for steps and workout, adds up points each day, and at the end shows the total points earned and whether the user earned the reward.

3. WeightedGrade_Calculator (Based on Average Course Grade Program). Description: This program calculates a student's final grade based on different course components, each with a specific weight. The user enters scores for tests, quizzes, a midterm, project, final exam, and homework. The program calculates the final weighted average and determines the letter grade. Grade Breakdown:2 Tests → 20%, 4 Quizzes → 20%, 1 Midterm → 15%,1 Project → 20%, 1 Final Exam → 15%, and Homework → 10%. How It Works: Asks the user to enter their grades, applies weights to each category to compute a final average, and displays the final average and letter grade.

4. StadiumSeating_Concert (Based on Stadium Seating Program). Description: This program calculates total income from ticket sales for a Hozier concert in New Britain, CT. The stadium has three seating classes, each with a different ticket price and seat limit. How It Works: Asks the user how many tickets were sold for each seating class, validates that sales do not exceed the seat limits, calculates income per class and total income, displays a summary of tickets sold and income generated.

5. BudgetAnalysis_Program (Based on Budget Analysis). Description: This program helps users manage their monthly finances by tracking income, needs, and wants. The program calculates total spending and tells the user whether they are under or over budget. How It Works: Prompts user for total monthly income, asks for expenses in two categories: Needs: Rent, Car, Utilities, Groceries, Other. Wants: Dining Out, Entertainment, Trips, Other.  Calculations: Total expenses, remaining balance, whether the user is over, under, or exactly on budget

6. UnitConverterGUI (Based on Kilometer Conversion Program). Description: This program converts miles to kilometers, pounds to kilograms, and height in inches to centimeters. I created this program because different countries use different measurement systems. For example, in the U.S. people use inches, miles, and pounds, while in Brazil we use centimeters, kilometers, and kilograms. This is helpful to me personally and to others who move between different systems. How It Works: The user enters a value into the appropriate field, then clicks a Convert button. The program performs the correct conversion and displays the result.

7. Evens&Odds_game (Based on the structure of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game). Description: This program simulates a two-player dice game where each player rolls two dice per round. After a set number of rounds, the program adds up each player's totals and the one with the highest sum wins. How It Works: The user enters how many rounds they want to play. In each round, the program randomly rolls two dice for each player and prints the result. It keeps track of the total score for both players. At the end, it compares the totals and announces the winner or a tie.

8.RollingTheDice_Game (Based on Random Numbers Problem Program).  Description: This is a simple two-player dice game. Each player rolls two dice every round, and the program adds up their scores. After all rounds, the player with the highest total sum wins. How It Works: The user chooses how many rounds to play. In each round, both players roll two dice. The program keeps track of the scores and announces the winner at the end. Input is checked to make sure it's a valid number.
